            <p>
              POLIXE believes in providing excellent service and strives to be sincere and transparent in its approach to customer service. Your confidence in us is of paramount importance to us and we would never place our personal growth before your interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Policy aims to minimize instances of customer complaints, grievances, and disputes through a channelized approach of review and redress. Your feedback will help us in identifying shortcomings in our product features and service delivery. Your satisfaction is our main objective in our quest to build a healthy customer relationship and deliver excellent service.
            </p>
            <p>
              POLIXE has developed a procedure for the prompt attention to the grievances of its customers with respect to various issues by setting up a “customer support” and “a dispute resolution mechanism”.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h3>The following are the foundational principles of this policy:</h3>
            <p>Transparency;</p>
            <p>
              Prompt, courteous and timeous response to all queries, enquiries, and complaints; and
            </p>
            <p>
              Constantly developing new and smarter mechanisms to receive and address customer grievances. The details of the dispute resolution mechanism are placed in the domain of public knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              A dispute may occur as a result of several reasons. It may be because of the difference in the service expected and the service delivered. A dispute may also arise as a result of technical or non-technical errors in the system or at times due to human inadvertence or error.
            </p>
            <p>
              POLIXE provides a user-friendly platform to all its customers to file a complaint/ share feedback if they are disappointed by the services rendered. Customers can give their complaint/ feedback in sending an email to (INSERT CUSTOMER SERVICE EMAIL HERE).
            </p>
            <p>
              If the user’s grievance is not resolved within the stipulated time frame, or if the user is not completely satisfied with the solution provided by POLIXE, then they can approach our dispute resolution system with their complaint or explore other legal avenues available for dispute resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
              To make POLIXE'S dispute resolution system more meaningful and effective, a structured system has been put in place. This system will ensure that the complaints are redressed seamlessly and well within the stipulated time frame.
            </p>
